## Introduction

### Dataset

The dataset is the famous movie rating dataset - Movielens, in
particular itâ€™s 10M version, that consists of 10 millions ratings
provided by users on movies.

Dataset is divided basically for training set - 9M ratings and
validation set - 1M ratings.

### Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to train the model that will properly predict
the ratings for new pairs of users and ratings.

## Method

The method used for the model training is collaborative filtering 2-rank
matrix factorization. The analysis was performed manually without
additional libraries used.

The closed form solution was used for minimizing the objective function.

Firstly, the training set was divided again for regularization, choosing
the best learning coefficient - lambda.

After we get the Lambda that works best for our training-validation set,
the model was trained on the hole training set with the best Lambda
parameter. And validated with the initial validation set.

## Results

**RMSE** on validation set is approximately **0.835**. This result is
considered as pretty solid.

## Conclusion

Although the results of the given model are pretty good, the model can
be improved even more.

Potential improvements: \* Try higher rank matrix factorization \*
Consider Neural Networks to improve results
